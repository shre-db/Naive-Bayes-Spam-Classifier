# Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classifier


This project is about building a simple SMS spam classifier using Naive-Bayes machine learning model. Data is cleaned and preprocessed using NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. A model pipeline is built for convenient preprocessing of data, model training and inference. Accuracy and ROC-AUC scores are used to evaluate the model's performance. 

|Metric|Train score|Test score|
|:-|-:|-:|
|Accuracy Score|99.33%|99.19%|
|ROC-AUC Score|98.34%|96.98%|

The results showed that the model was neither underfitting nor overfitting.
